jQuery Truncate
===========

This plugin is used for truncating text with javascript based on the number of lines (not characters). Which is very usefull for designs where you only want to display - for example - 4 lines of text. It is re-adjusted to make it usefull for responsive designs and is really easy to use.

How to use
--------
You can use it by simply adding a data attribute named "truncate" and set a numeric value for the number of lines.
